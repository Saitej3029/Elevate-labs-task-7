Research Notes: Risks of Malicious Browser Extensions
How Malicious Extensions Harm Users

Data Theft: Extensions with access to "all website data" can capture sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, or personal data entered in forms.
Ad Injection: Malicious extensions may inject unwanted ads or redirect users to phishing sites.
Tracking: Some extensions track browsing habits and sell data to third parties without user consent.
Malware Delivery: Extensions can run scripts for crypto-mining, keylogging, or other malicious activities.

Common Red Flags

Excessive permissions (e.g., access to all tabs, history, or webcam).
Unknown or unverified developers.
Poor or no reviews on the extension store.
Vague or misleading descriptions.
